# Llama 2

We're excited to announce that very soon, Nosana will be able to handle Llama 2 workloads. This feature will allow you to leverage underutilized hardware across the network to run AI operations, thereby significantly reducing costs.

If you would like to participate in testing features, please contact us to join our private beta.
